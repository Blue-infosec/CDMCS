> Bro is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.

>  Key to understanding Bro lies in realizing that even though the system comes with such powerful functionality out of the box, fundamentally it represents a platform for traffic analyses that’s fully customizable and extensible: Bro provides users with a domain-specific, Turing-complete scripting language for expressing arbitrary analysis tasks. Conceptually, you can think of Bro as a “domain-specific Python” (or Perl): just like Python, the system comes with a large set of pre-built functionality (the “standard library”), yet you are not limited to what the system ships with but can put Bro to use in novel ways by writing your own code. Indeed, all of Bro’s default analyses, including all the logging, is the result of such scripts; there’s no specific analysis hard-coded into the core of system.
