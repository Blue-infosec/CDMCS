# Logging

> Once Bro has been deployed in an environment and monitoring live traffic, it will, in its default configuration, begin to produce human-readable ASCII logs. Each log file, produced by Broâ€™s Logging Framework, is populated with organized, mostly connection-oriented data. As the standard log files are simple ASCII data, working with the data contained in them can be done from a command line terminal once you have been familiarized with the types of data that can be found in each file.
