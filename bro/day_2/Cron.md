# BRO Cron

> The BroControl cron command performs housekeeping tasks, such as checking whether Bro is running or not (and starting or stopping to match the expected state, as needed), checking if there is sufficient free disk space, etc. This command is intended to be run from a cron job, rather than interactively by a user.



# Elasticsearch Curator


> Like a museum curator manages the exhibits and collections on display, Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage your indices.

## but what if *broctl cron* & *curator* is not doing what you want ?

* write your own bash||perl||ruby||.. script
