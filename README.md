# Cyber Defence Monitoring Course Suite (CDMCS)

This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment.

The material is missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.

This is .5 + 3 + .5 days of material for any intermediate-level dev-ops who has some experience with other security|monitoring tools and wants to learn Suricata, Bro and Moloch. We believe these classes are perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Suricata, Bro and Moloch or who wants a more thorough understanding of the three and their internals.
