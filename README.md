This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. 

The material is missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class. 

This is 5 days of material for any intermediate-level devops who has some experience with other security|monitoring tools and wants to learn Suricata, Bro or Moloch. We believe these classes are perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Suricata, Bro and Moloch or who wants a more thorough understanding of the tool and its internals.
